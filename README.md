This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code, using Ruby, Rust, C#, Python, and TypeScript. These solutions work but are not necessarily optimized for performance or code clarity.

Please note that not all challenges are completed. Each year, I reach a point where I choose to stop, either due to a lack of interest or unwillingness to allocate more time to the event.
